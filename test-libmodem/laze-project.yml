      # Modem initalization runs in a thread, and the way libmodem.a works, it
      # needs to wait for an interrupt to come in during nrf_modem_os_timedwait
      # because nrf_modem_os_is_in_isr would always return true.
      # (Alternatively, could set an os-irq, but this is easier for
      # exploration).
