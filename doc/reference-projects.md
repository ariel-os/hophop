# Available baseline tools

As a baseline for any trouble related to getting the PHY working, see those two projects from <https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf>:

* [samples/dect/dect_phy/hello_dect](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/main/samples/dect/dect_phy/hello_dect)
* [samples/dect/dect_phy/dect_shell](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/main/samples/dect/dect_phy/dect_shell)

Both are based on Zephyr and the Nordic SDK;
if you are not familiar with that, they are set up like this:

<!--

## Failed Zephyr-style approach

* [Ensure the DECT firmware is flashed](./dect-firmware.md) (or don't, just to see which errors happen)
* Inside the main SDK,
  * `python3 -m venv .venv` (just installing west via pipx does not quite suffice, as there will later be more dependencies that have to be satisified in the same Python environment)
  * `source .venv/bin/activate`
  * `pip install west`
  * `rm -rf zephyr` (not needed when going through nrfutil installation -- but that's a pretty big SDK bloat)
  * `west init`
  * `git checkout zephyr` (not sure if needed)
* Inside the sample project,
  * `west packages pip --install`
  * `west update`
  * `west zephyr-export` (probably not needed)
  * `source ../../../../zephyr/zephyr-env.sh` (maybe needed?)
  * `west sdk install` â˜• (probably there's a shorter version that suffices, but --toolchains arm-zephyr-eabi wasn't it) -- and beware this installs into ~/zephyr-sdk-0.17.4/
  * `west build -p --board nrf9151dk/nrf9151dk/ns` (for the hello, add ` -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-eu.conf`)
  * `west flash`
    ... still doesn't work

-->

## Building and installing using the Nordic toolchain

Based on <https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-3.2.0-preview2/page/nrf/installation/install_ncs.html>

* [Ensure the DECT firmware is flashed](./dect-firmware.md) (or don't, just to see which errors happen)
* `nrfutil install sdk-manager` (installs into `~/.nrfutil`)
* `nrfutil sdk-manager install v3.2.0-preview2` (installs into `~/ncs/`)
* `nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version v3.2.0-preview2 --shell` (spawns new shell with many environment variables set)
* `cd ~/ncs/v3.2.0-preview2/nrf/samples/dect/dect_phy/dect_shell/`
* `west update`
* `source ~/ncs/v3.2.0-preview2/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh` (or with added `-- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-eu.conf` for the hello)
* `west build -p -b nrf9151dk/nrf9151/ns`
* `west flash`, or `probe-rs download --protocol swd --chip nRF9160_xxAA build/merged.hex --binary-format ihex`

## Failure modes

### Wrong network core

This is the DECT shell's startup crash when the stock firmware is on the network core:


```
All pins have been configured as non-secure
Booting TF-M v2.1.1-ncs4
[Sec Thread] Secure image initializing!
TF-M isolation level is: 0x00000001
TF-M Float ABI: Hard
Lazy stacking enabled
*** Booting nRF Connect SDK v3.0.0-3bfc46578e42 ***
*** Using Zephyr OS v4.0.99-3e0ce7636fa6 ***

Reset reason: PIN reset
